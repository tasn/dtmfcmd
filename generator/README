ADDED BY TAsn:
This is used for dtmfcmd debugging, lanuch ./dialer c for terminal version and /dialer without any option for X11 version.
You have to make a fifo (mkfifo) and set the fifo name in dial.c (constant).
Then cat the content of the fifo to the stdin of dtmfcmd and don't forget setting the dtmfcmd options: -r "8000 1 8".
Those will tell the encoding of the data in the pipe.
an example:
$ ./dtmfcmd -s 8000 -r "8000 1 8" < ../generator/8bit.fifo

Happy debugging.

DTMF generator for those without a touch-tone phone.

Push the buttons.  Hear the DTMF tones.  Pretty simple.

It works for me (tm)
