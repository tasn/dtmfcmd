== MAJOR ==

* decide the big chunk's optimal size

== MINOR ==

* improve the play sound function

* run with a profiler?

* (main function) after errors should not exit before cleaning, fix that, and generally clean the code more.

* rule checking should be a hash table?

* maybe use the newer dsp.c? works better? should verify, check the differences the noob added.

* change the ugly do_* names.

== FUTURE IDEAS ==

* make a seperate config package (moko-hack), this package should be the clean app

* add suport for sample rates other than 8000?

* add more special commands?

* add volume config options. (i.e, write a volume altering app/script and use it)

* drop glib and implement my own list (and make it as general as possible)
